To be young and in love in New York City (In New York City)
To not know who I am, but still know that I'm good long as you're here with me
To be drunk and in love in New York City (In New York City)
Midnight into morning coffee
Burning through the hours talking

Damn, I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time
I'd stay for a long time 'cause
I like me better when
I like me better when I'm with you

I don't know what it is, but I got that feeling (got that feeling)
Wakin' up in this bed next to you
Swear the room, yeah, got no ceiling
If we lay, let the day just pass us by
I might get to too much talking
I might have to tell you somethin'

I like me better when I'm with you
I like me better when I'm with you
I knew from the first time
I'd stay for a long time 'cause
I like me better when
I like me better when I'm with you

Stay awhile, stay awhile
Stay here with me
Stay awhile, stay awhile, oh
Stay awhile, stay awhile
Stay here with me
Lay here with me
Eh-eh, eh-eh, oh

I like me better when I'm with you (yes I do, yes I do babe)
I like me better when I'm with you (oh no)
I knew from the first time
I'd stay for a long time 'cause
I like me better when
I like me better when I'm with you
I'm with you
